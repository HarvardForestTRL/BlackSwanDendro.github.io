I am a PhD candidate at the University of Tennessee in the Environmental Change Laboratory where I use tree-ring proxies to estimate annually-resolved past environmental conditions. I am particularly interested in the methods of applied statistics which allow us to make these estimates, and I am a strong proponent of open science and reproducible research.
