My most-used resource for learning and using R is R for Data Science. The [book]("https://r4ds.had.co.nz/") is available online for free, the [community]("https://www.rfordatasci.com/") is super helpful and inclusive, and [tidy tuesday]('https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday') is a great way to learn and practice

I can confidently say that the best textbook I've ever read is [Statistical Rethinking]("https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/") by Richard McElreath. Not just for those interested in Bayesian methods, in my opinion. This book helped clarify so many concepts for me, and was enjoyable to read.
